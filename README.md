### Self_Assessment

Tornadoes project was fun.  When we started out looking for datasets, it was surprising that they all had the same information.  We tried to use the magnatude as a variable but we were not able to use it.  Once we had the variables set the fun began.  We used Jupyter Notebook to read in the datasets.  Cleaned them up by dropping redundent columns and pulling the detail we believed would get the results we were looking for.  

My role in the group was not realy established.  I tried to pick up the slack.  I spent time going through the datasets trying to get the information to produce some results, but I was not that successful. I started the Google Slides, and the rest of the team added detail once we were able to answer the questions we set up to answer. I felt I kept the team on target.  Making sure we were getting everything completed and in an order we can tell a story. 

The team worked well together, we had our own strengths that really brought the project together as a whole.  We went through the project the same way we created the project.  We started out in Jupyter Notebook, moved over to Colab, then to SQL and into Machine Learning testing and training.  I was fun playing around with the data.  I was not able to actually get anything to fully work. So, I turned to finding pictures for the Slide presentation.  I fould several photos, and was very happy with the final choice.  

My biggest challeng was my interent speed not supporting the programs.  I completed my last few classes at my son's apartmnet in downtown Nashville. For faster internet speed.  It helped.  I was able to communicate with the rest of my team without sounding like a robot.  I was also, able to complete a majority of my past due challenges because the codes actually ran.  It was a great satisfaction and accomplishment.

### In Closing

Thank you for the opportuninty to learn Data Visulation.  I had no idea there were so many programs, or that I use a majority of them everyday.  I do wish I chose a course that was a slower pace.  I will review all the modules again and work them until I understand.
